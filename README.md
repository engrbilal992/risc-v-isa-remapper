# DeadDialect

> *Every boot speaks a different language. Yesterday's binary is today's dead code.*

A session-unique RISC-V ISA remapping system. Every time the system boots, it generates a fresh cryptographic permutation of the instruction set. Binaries compiled for one session are cryptographically rejected in the next. Malware that survives a reboot cannot execute — it speaks a dead dialect.

---

## The Idea

Standard ISAs are fixed contracts. Every program, every library, every piece of malware agrees on what `0x13` means, what syscall 64 does, which register is the stack pointer. DeadDialect breaks that contract every session.

```
Boot A:  addi = 0x13,  write = syscall 64,   t0 = x5
Boot B:  addi = 0x33,  write = syscall 178,  t0 = x19
Boot C:  addi = 0x67,  write = syscall 291,  t0 = x23
```

A binary compiled for Boot A is nonsense on Boot B. It either executes the wrong instructions, calls the wrong kernel functions, or fails the cryptographic fingerprint check — whichever comes first.

## Architecture

```
256-bit session seed  (os.urandom)
         │
         ├─── opcode permutation   →  /etc/isa/map              12!  ≈ 2²⁹
         ├─── register permutation →  /etc/isa/register_keyring 21!  ≈ 2⁶⁵
         └─── syscall permutation  →  /etc/isa/syscall_keyring  436! ≈ 2³⁰⁰⁰⁺
                                                                 ─────────────
                                               Combined entropy: 2³⁰⁹⁴⁺
```

Three independent layers. An attacker who breaks one still faces the other two.

## Fingerprint Protocol

Every compiled binary carries a 24-bit cryptographic fingerprint embedded as two harmless `addi x0,x0,N` NOPs at the start of `.text`. These are true RISC-V NOPs — they write to the zero register and have no architectural effect — but they encode the session proof.

```
QEMU sees fingerprint NOPs + matching keyring  →  RUN
QEMU sees fingerprint NOPs + wrong keyring     →  SIGILL
QEMU sees no fingerprint  + active keyring     →  SIGILL  ← standard binary blocked
QEMU sees fingerprint NOPs + empty keyring     →  SIGILL  ← remapped binary blocked
```

The fingerprint is derived from `SHA-256(seed)`. No collisions found in the first 100,000 seeds tested.

## Security Properties

### What it stops
- **Malware persistence** — any binary from a previous session is dead on next boot
- **Pre-compiled exploits** — shellcode for a fixed ISA fails immediately
- **Replay attacks** — binaries from one session cannot execute in another
- **Standard QEMU execution** — remapped binaries require the patched executor

### Why the entropy matters

```
Guessing register permutation:  1 in 21!  ≈ 1 in 51 quintillion
Guessing syscall permutation:   1 in 436! ≈ 1 in 10^(1000+)
Guessing both simultaneously:   not a viable attack
```

### POC scope
- `-march=rv64g` required (RVC compressed instructions not yet handled)
- Static binaries only for test programs (dynamic support via `isa_remap_ldso.h`)
- Attacks completing within a single session are not addressed

---

## How Each Layer Works

### Register (`register_mapping.h`)
21 of 32 RISC-V registers shuffled. ABI registers frozen. QEMU hook uses `OPCODE_FIELDS` table — only actual register fields remapped, immediates never touched (Curtis's fix).

| Frozen | Shuffleable |
|---|---|
| x0 x1 x2 x10-x17 | x3-x9, x18-x31 (21 regs) |

### Syscall (`syscall_mapping.h`)
436 Linux RISC-V syscalls permuted. One line in `do_syscall()`. mtime-reload — keyring updates without QEMU restart.

### Opcode (`isa_mapping.h`)
12 primary opcodes shuffled. Decode hook in `translate.c` restores standard opcode before decoder.

### ld.so (`isa_remap_ldso.h`)
musl dynamic linker patch — remaps `.text` of every loaded ELF at load time. Cannot be bypassed via `LD_PRELOAD`. Requires Alpine musl rebuild.

## Future Directions

- ARM support (same concept, different fixed ISA contract)
- Kernel `.text` remapping pre-boot
- Hardware FPGA implementation
- Hacker News / academic publication
- GitHub Sponsors
